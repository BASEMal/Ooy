  By the end of this topic, you should be able to: 
1.	Explain the concepts of data, information,  
metadata, data dictionary, database, and the  
	database management system (DBMS). 
2.	Compare and contrast the traditional file  	
systems versus the database systems. 
3.	Differentiate various DBMS users, DBMS  
	languages, schemas and subschemas,  
    DBMS <em>architecture, and the client-server architecture.      
Importance of Data Resource 
	Data is the most critical resource of an  
    	organization that enables it to gain  	
        competitive advantage.  Examples of data  	
        are customers, products and prices.   
        	Knowing the right customers looking for the  	
            right products at the right prices will give you 
             	the chance to sell, increase your revenue  </em>	
                and profit.  That enables an organization to 
                survive and prosper.  Other resources are also 
                important ‚Äì e.g. human, financial, etc.

Importance of DB Systems 
	In this age of information explosion, 
    	everybody is bombarded with data and  
        	information.  Thus, giving the right data (i.e.  	information)
            to the right people at the right 
             	time is very crucial.  As a result, only 
                 	organizations that manage information very  
                    	well can survive and prosper.  The task of  
                        	managing data and extracting useful information in
                             a timely manner can be simplified by the use of database
    
                             systems.

What is Database? 
A database is simply a collection of related  
	data organized in a certain way to make  
    	sure that data can be easily stored,  
        	searched, retrieved, or deleted.  A database  
            	system is an integrated collection of related 
                 	files along with the interpretation of data.  A  
                    	database  management system (DBMS) is a  
                        	computer  program that allows access to the data 
                             contained in a database ‚Äì thus, it needs a
                             database to work on.

Data vs. Information? 
The term ‚Äúdata‚Äù refer to the raw facts and  
	figures that need to be processed and  
    	refined to become ‚Äúinformation‚Äù.  Thus,  
        	information is a refined form of data.  Quality  
            	information means information that is  
                	accurate, timely and relevant.  To have that  	
                    
            quality, information needs a good database 
            	‚Äì not only to store the needed data but also  	
                to ensure that data can be accessed by  
                	different programs used by different people. 
Examples of Data and Information 
	Examples of data are boys, girls, 25 years  
    	old, 60 kg, Malaysia, Nigeria, Libya, etc. 
          	They are raw facts and figures which are  
            	not very meaningful. 
	An example of information is ‚Äì there are 20  
    	boys and 15 girls in the class.  This is more
         	meaningful than data.  Now you know how  
            	many boys and girls in the class so that you 
                 	can plan a class of the right size. 
                                </ul>

Organizational Survival 
Data constitutes the building blocks of  	information.   
	Information is produced by processing data.    
    	Information reveals the meaning of data.   
	Good, timely, relevant information is key to  	decision making.   
	Good decision making is key to organizational survival. 
Examples of Databases 
	Examples of databases are telephone  	
    directory, bank accounts, library catalogue,  
    	hotel rooms, groceries in supermarkets, a  
        	list of names and addresses, etc.  
	If there are 20 million taxpayers and each  	
    taxpayer needs 2K characters of data, you  
    	can calculate how big the database is. 
	Amazon.com has more than 15 million  
    	visitors per day; with 100 people responsible for database update. 
 
University Example 
	A UNIVERSITY database is for maintaining  
    information concerning students, courses, 
     and grades in a university environment. 
	We have: 
  	STUDENT file stores data on each student; 
  	COURSE file stores data on each course; 
  	SECTION file stores data on each section  	of each course; 
  	GRADE_REPORT file stores the grades  	that students receive; and 
 	PREREQUISITE file stores the prerequisites

What makes up a DB? 
	A database (DB) is organized by fields,  
    	records and files as described below: 
 Field is the smallest unit of the data that has  	
 meaning to its users.  It is also called data  	
 item or data element. Name, Address and  	
 Telephone number are examples of fields.  
 Record is a collection of logically related  	
 fields.  Each field possesses a fixed number  
 	of bytes and is of fixed data type.  Each field have some value. 
What makes up a DB? 
	(cont.)  A database (DB) is organized by  
    fields, records and files  ‚Ä¶  
 File is a collection of related records. 
 	Generally, all records in a file are of the 
    same size and same record type.  However  	
    sometimes, records in a file may be of  	
    variable length.  Telephone directory is an  
    	example of a file containing records of different telephone owners.

Purpose of DB Systems 
	DBMS were developed to overcome the  	following problems of the 
    file systems with  	conventional operating systems:    ÔÉ¢ Data redundancy
     and inconsistency 
	Difficulty in accessing data 
	Data isolation ‚Äì multiple files and formats 
	Integrity problems 
	Atomicity of updates 
	Concurrent access by multiple users 
	Security problems 
What is DBMS? 
	As defined earlier, a DBMS is a collection  
    	of computer programs that enable users to  
        	create and maintain a database (DB).  It 
             	needs a DB to work on. A DB  contains end 
                	user data and metadata. 
	DBMS manages DB structure, controls  	
    access to data, and contains a query  	
    language.  It makes data management  	
    more efficient and effective. 
What is Query Language? 
	Query Language allows quick answers to 
     ad hoc queries; provides better access to  
     	more and better-managed data; promotes  
        
        integrated view of organization‚Äôs operations; 
        	and reduces the probability of inconsistent  	data. 
	Querying is a kind of DB manipulation  e.g.  	
     	Retrieve a transcript; 
  	List the prerequisites of the Database  	 	course. 
                    </ul>
                </li>
            
            </details>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    
                <details>
                    <summary style="color: plum;">Enter here 10 </summary>
What is Metadata? 
	Metadata is data about data.  It describes  
    	data objects in the DB and makes easier for  
        	them to be accessed.  Metadata describes  
            	the DB structure, sizes of data types,  	
                constraints, applications, authorization, etc. 
	Author, date created, date modified, and file  size are other 
    examples of very basic 
document metadata.  Thus, metadata  makes it much easier for 
someone to locate  a specific  document. 
3 Types of Metadata 
  	Descriptive metadata: In a traditional  	
    library cataloging ‚Äì title, abstract, author and  
    	keywords are examples of meta data. 
  	Structural metadata: This is data about  	
    the containers of data.  E.g. how pages are  	
    ordered to form chapters. 
  	Administrative metadata: This provides  	
    information like when and how it was  
    	created, file type, and other technical  
        	information, and who can access it. 
What is Data Dictionary? 
 Data dictionary (DD) is a centralized repository of 
 information about data such as its meaning, relationship 
 to other data, origin, usage, and format.  It assists the 
 management, DBAs and others in planning, controlling, 
 and evaluating the collection, storage and use of data. 
 Specifically, DD for the database contains definitions 
 of items like entities, attributes, relationships, processes, etc. at 
  their most decomposed level. 
What is Data Dictionary? 
 	Each entry in the DD begins with the name  
    	of an item, defines which of the above  
        	categories the item belongs to, and so on. 
  	It may also contain additional information  	
    about the items defined, such as frequency,  
    	volume, size, affected users, security and  
        	implementation.  However, it is not a good  
            	practice to overload the DD with too much  
                	of comments, because this will make the  
                    	tool more difficult to maintain. 
 
 
DBMS Manages Interaction 
 
1.21 
Typical DBMS Functionality 
‚Ä¢	Define a particular DB in terms of its data types, structures, and constraints. 
‚Ä¢	Construct or Load the initial DB contents on a secondary storage medium. 
‚Ä¢	Manipulate the DB: 
Retrieval: Querying, generating reports; 
Modification: Insertions, deletions and updates to its content; 
Accessing the DB through Web applications 
‚Ä¢	Share a DB allows multiple users and programs to access the DB simultaneously. 
 	1.22 
DBMS Functions 
 	Data dictionary management; 
 	Data storage management; 
 	Data transformation and presentation; 
 	Security management; 
 	Multiuser access control; 
 	Backup and recovery management; 
 	Data integrity management; 
  Database language and application      programming interfaces; 
 	Database communication interfaces; etc. 
Advantages of using DBMS 
Among the advantages of using DBMS  approach are: 
    Restricting unauthorized access to data; 
    Providing Storage Structures (e.g. indexes) 
 	for efficient Query Processing; 
    Providing backup and recovery services; 
    Providing multiple interfaces to different  	classes of users; 
   Representing complex relationships among  	data; etc. 
1.24 
When NOT to use DBMS? 
	The overhead cost of using DBMS is high
    	e.g. high initial investment in hardware,  
        software and training; high cost of defining  
        	and processing data; and the overhead for 
             	security, concurrency control, recovery, and 
                	integrity functions 
                    traditional data files when the  	
                    applications are simple and not likely to  
                    	change; and when there is no multiple-user  	
                        access to data. 
 
Files vs. Databases 
 In the traditional file environment, a data file 
 is built around the application that uses the files.
   Thus, if there are ten application  programs, there
    would be ten files created.  However, in the database environment, 
    applications are built around one integrated database.  Ideally,
     a database is independent of the applications.  Thus, duplication 
     of data between files is normally cited as the principal disadvantage
     of the file system. 
Files vs. Databases 
  	Over time, multiple applications result in  
    	duplicated data, duplicate input, duplicate  
        	maintenance, duplicate storage, and  		
            possibly data integrity errors.  Data integrity 
             is due to data becoming inconsistent with  	
             one another as more duplicates taking  	place.
               All these redundancies and  	inconsistency of 
               data in the traditional files  	can be overcome 
               by using the database  	system.

File Environment 
	In the file environment, data storage 
(file) is built 
around the application (information system) that uses the files. 
Disadvantages of Using Files 
 	Data Redundancy; 
 	Data Inconsistency; 
 	Data Integration (lacking); 
 	Program Dependence (too tied-up with); 
 	Data Dependence (too tied-up with);

DBMS Users 
 DBMS users can be categorized into various types.  The following are the
  categories:  
 Firstly, they are the normal end-users who  	
 do not realize about the database at all ‚Äì 
 	e.g. the bank ATM users, people ordering  
    	books on-line, etc.   
 Secondly, they are the on-line users who  
 	know about the database and the limited  
    	functions they can do.  They are more 
         	knowledgeable than the first one above.

    	content, the structure, the constraints, and  
        	functions or transactions  against the DB.  
            	They must communicate with the end-users  
                	and understand their needs.
